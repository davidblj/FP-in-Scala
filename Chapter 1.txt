What is functional programming

Functional programming ( FP ) is based on a simple premise with far-reaching impli-
cations: we construct our programs using only pure functions. in other words, functions that have no side effects
What are side effects? A function has a side effect if it does something other than simply return a result.

this implies:

    Modifying a variable
    Modifying a data structure in place
    Setting a field on an object
    Throwing an exception or halting with an error
    Printing to the console or reading user input
    Reading from or writing to a file
    Drawing on the screen

How is this possible ?The answer is that functional programming is a restriction on how we write programs, 
but not on how programs can express

Pure functions brings modularity, pure functions are easier to test, reuse, parallelize, generalize, and reason about.

There are 2 important concepts:

    referential transparency
    substitution model
